## Container/Presentational Principle

carries all the logic -> functions for handling state changes, internal component state, etc.

presentational components -> used just for displaying desired markup.

Notes
--------------
1) run 'npm run-script build' to manually build via webpack

2) run 'npm run-script watch' to tell webpack to watch your files for new changes, then build

3) run 'npm start' to start the web server and display your page. The root page can be configured for this in the webpack.config.js file. This will refresh on each change to the project.
